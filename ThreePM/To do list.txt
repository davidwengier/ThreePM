--- TO DO ---
Lyrics in the database:
	- Maybe timing, for karaoke (future)
		- Overlay the current line onto the top of the screen :)
Auto-updating
HTTP server
	- Proper song refreshing (ajax)
	- skinnable
	- any missing tag info
	- album tracks
	- port configuration
Skinning: 
	Read images from files
	Make XUL like thing (ie, specify what control goes where, build up any form in any way, specify an Action for buttons etc.)
	- Start with a SkinnableForm that reads in a seperate XML and build from there
Ratings
Proper song ticker for long names, with its own timer and pausing at start/end
Work out how to get the right GUID for AlbumArt_ display - it may be not possible though, could be in WMP library
Audioscrobbler plugin
Get album cover from last.fm/wikipedia/amazon
Seperate channel volume (
Crossfading/gapless (may need DSP/3D/EAX)


--- ANDREW'S LIST ---
X	Listen for the delete button in playlist
X	Move "The" to the end of artist names in the treeview
X	Drag and drop from the search form to the playlist
X	Drag and drop from the library to the playlist
X	Option to hide ignored artists in the treeview
X	Option to hide ignored artists from everywhere! (Where else is there?)
X	Artist/Album list in treeview
X	Unselect selected items in the playlist if the user clicks on a selected item and is not dragging
X	Timer on the search form, context menu with queue artist/album
N	Integrated tag editing?
X	Library info editing - will get overridden if someone updates tags!
X	Sort library by artist, album, track number
X	Arrow keys to skip like 5 seconds in the player
	Would be cool but hard to display some artist info from wikipedia/last.fm/wherever
X	Skinning (projected for sometime in 2008)

--- ALBUM PANEL ---
	Make sure the original mode still works
	Cache and dispose brushes, pens etc
	Tidy up the code
X	When the center album is drawn with details, <s>move things out to the left and right and</s> keep scrolling
	Make scrolling start based on cursor position from the edge of the screen rather than the hovered album
	It appears to spasm a bit when scrolling to the left
	Order by Artist, Album with a bit along the top that shows the artists being displayed or something?
	Search for artists by typing like in the tree
	More options -> play/queue artist/album/song, download cover art etc
	Separate out the image scrolling functionality into a control that takes as properties a control to show details and context menus and stuff so that we can put it in StarRez to show scrolling entries and the context menu could be like a rating system and staff could rate the attractiveness of everyone in their system and the control could show their stats eg age, gender, profile items etc.  That would be cool

--- BUGS ---
X	Can't double-click in the playlist
	NotifyForm doesnt come back up when you change songs while its on the way down
	NotifyForm generally gimpy
